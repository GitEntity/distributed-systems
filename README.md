##### Instructions
Here are the instructions for running my client/server application.

Navigate to the folder that contains the .java files.

Compile the server (MTServer.java) on a CMD window. Run the server on the same window.
Compile the client (Client.java) on another CMD window. Run the client on this window.

Follow the prompts on the client. The program will run until you decide to terminate (ctrl + c).

You may also run multiple client CMD windows.
 
A log file will show up in the same folder with the results appended. "Gas Mileage Results.txt" 

##### Description
Provides a client with useful fuel mileage information pertaining to their vehicle and a possible trip they may take. 

The application will ask the user about the fuel economy of their vehicle, along with the distance of the trip, and the amount of fuel in the vehicle. With this information, the server will determine how much fuel will be left inside the vehicle, and the server will also determine how far the vehicle can possibly travel to the destination. Additionally, a small diagram will be shown, demonstrating how far the vehicle will get it to the destination.
